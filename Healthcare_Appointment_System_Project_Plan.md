## Conclusion

This comprehensive project plan and system requirements document outlines the development of a blockchain-based healthcare appointment system with integrated payment gateways (esewa and khalti). The system is designed to handle medium-scale operations across multiple healthcare facilities, serving 100-1000 users daily.

The document provides detailed functional and non-functional requirements, technology recommendations, project timeline, and risk management strategies. By following this plan, the development team can create a secure, efficient, and user-friendly appointment system that leverages blockchain technology for enhanced security and transparency.

The proposed 20-week timeline allows for thorough planning, development, testing, and deployment, with clear milestones and deliverables at each phase. Regular stakeholder involvement and a comprehensive testing strategy will ensure the final system meets all requirements and provides value to patients, healthcare providers, and administrators.
