# Database Optimization Recommendations

This document provides recommendations for optimizing the Healthcare Appointment System database for performance, security, and reliability.

## Performance Optimization

### Indexing Strategy

#### Current Indexes
- Primary keys (clustered indexes)
- Foreign keys (non-clustered indexes)
- Specific columns for filtering and sorting

#### Additional Recommended Indexes

1. **Composite Indexes for Common Query Patterns**
   ```sql
   -- For appointment searches by provider and date range
   CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_provider_date ON appointments(provider_id, scheduled_date_time);
   
   -- For patient appointment history
   CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_patient_date ON appointments(patient_id, scheduled_date_time);
   
   -- For provider availability searches
   CREATE INDEX idx_availabilities_provider_day_time ON availabilities(provider_id, day_of_week, start_time);
   ```

2. **Filtered Indexes for Specific Queries**
   ```sql
   -- For active users only
   CREATE INDEX idx_users_active ON users(id) WHERE is_active = TRUE;
   
   -- For upcoming appointments
   CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_upcoming ON appointments(scheduled_date_time) 
   WHERE scheduled_date_time > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AND status IN ('Scheduled', 'Confirmed');
   
   -- For pending payments
   CREATE INDEX idx_payments_pending ON payments(id) WHERE status = 'Pending';
   ```

3. **Include Columns for Covering Indexes**
   ```sql
   -- For user authentication (covers common fields needed during login)
   CREATE INDEX idx_users_auth ON users(email) INCLUDE (password_hash, is_active, user_type);
   
   -- For appointment list views
   CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_list ON appointments(provider_id) 
   INCLUDE (scheduled_date_time, status, duration);
   ```

### Query Optimization

1. **Use Parameterized Queries**
   - Avoid string concatenation for SQL queries
   - Use query parameters to allow for query plan caching

2. **Pagination for Large Result Sets**
   ```sql
   -- Instead of SELECT * FROM appointments
   SELECT * FROM appointments
   ORDER BY scheduled_date_time DESC
   LIMIT 20 OFFSET 0;
   ```

3. **Selective Column Retrieval**
   - Avoid `SELECT *` in production code
   - Only retrieve the columns needed for each operation

4. **Efficient Joins**
   - Use INNER JOIN instead of LEFT JOIN when possible
   - Join on indexed columns
   - Consider denormalizing frequently joined data for read-heavy operations

### Caching Strategy

1. **Redis Caching Implementation**
   - Cache frequently accessed reference data (modules, menus, permissions)
   - Cache user session data
   - Cache appointment availability slots

2. **Cache Invalidation Strategy**
   - Time-based expiration for relatively static data
   - Event-based invalidation for frequently updated data
   - Versioned cache keys for complex objects

3. **Materialized Views for Reports**
   ```sql
   -- Create materialized view for appointment statistics
   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_appointment_stats AS
   SELECT 
       provider_id,
       COUNT(*) as total_appointments,
       SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'Completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed,
       SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'Canceled' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as canceled,
       SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'NoShow' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as no_shows
   FROM appointments
   GROUP BY provider_id;
   
   -- Refresh strategy
   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_appointment_stats;
   ```

## Security Enhancements

### Data Protection

1. **Column-Level Encryption**
   ```sql
   -- For sensitive patient data
   ALTER TABLE patients
   ADD COLUMN encrypted_medical_history bytea,
   ADD COLUMN medical_history_iv bytea;
   ```

2. **Row-Level Security Policies**
   ```sql
   -- Enable row-level security
   ALTER TABLE patients ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   
   -- Create policy for providers to see only their patients
   CREATE POLICY provider_patients_policy ON patients
   FOR SELECT
   USING (EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 FROM appointments
       WHERE appointments.patient_id = patients.id
       AND appointments.provider_id = current_setting('app.current_provider_id')::uuid
   ));
   ```

3. **Audit Logging Improvements**
   ```sql
   -- Create trigger function for comprehensive auditing
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION audit_trigger_function()
   RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
   DECLARE
       old_row_data jsonb;
       new_row_data jsonb;
       audit_row audit_logs;
   BEGIN
       IF (TG_OP = 'UPDATE') THEN
           old_row_data = to_jsonb(OLD);
           new_row_data = to_jsonb(NEW);
           audit_row = (
               uuid_generate_v4(),
               current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)::uuid,
               TG_TABLE_NAME,
               NEW.id::text,
               'Update',
               old_row_data::text,
               new_row_data::text,
               current_setting('app.client_ip', true),
               CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
           );
           INSERT INTO audit_logs VALUES (audit_row.*);
           RETURN NEW;
       ELSIF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN
           old_row_data = to_jsonb(OLD);
           audit_row = (
               uuid_generate_v4(),
               current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)::uuid,
               TG_TABLE_NAME,
               OLD.id::text,
               'Delete',
               old_row_data::text,
               NULL,
               current_setting('app.client_ip', true),
               CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
           );
           INSERT INTO audit_logs VALUES (audit_row.*);
           RETURN OLD;
       ELSIF (TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN
           new_row_data = to_jsonb(NEW);
           audit_row = (
               uuid_generate_v4(),
               current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)::uuid,
               TG_TABLE_NAME,
               NEW.id::text,
               'Create',
               NULL,
               new_row_data::text,
               current_setting('app.client_ip', true),
               CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
           );
           INSERT INTO audit_logs VALUES (audit_row.*);
           RETURN NEW;
       END IF;
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
   ```

### Access Control

1. **Database Role-Based Access**
   ```sql
   -- Create application roles
   CREATE ROLE app_readonly;
   CREATE ROLE app_readwrite;
   CREATE ROLE app_admin;
   
   -- Grant appropriate permissions
   GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO app_readonly;
   GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO app_readwrite;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO app_admin;
   
   -- Revoke sensitive operations
   REVOKE DELETE ON users FROM app_readwrite;
   ```

2. **Connection Pooling Configuration**
   - Implement PgBouncer for connection pooling
   - Configure appropriate pool sizes based on workload
   - Set up separate pools for read and write operations

## Reliability Improvements

### Backup and Recovery

1. **Automated Backup Strategy**
   ```bash
   # Daily full backup
   pg_dump -Fc healthcare_db > /backups/healthcare_$(date +%Y%m%d).dump
   
   # Point-in-time recovery with WAL archiving
   archive_command = 'cp %p /archive/%f'
   ```

2. **Backup Verification**
   - Regularly restore backups to test environments
   - Validate data integrity after restoration
   - Document and automate the recovery process

### High Availability

1. **Replication Setup**
   ```
   # In postgresql.conf on primary
   wal_level = replica
   max_wal_senders = 10
   
   # In pg_hba.conf
   host replication replicator 192.168.1.0/24 md5
   ```

2. **Failover Automation**
   - Implement Patroni or similar tool for automated failover
   - Configure health checks and monitoring
   - Test failover scenarios regularly

### Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Performance Monitoring Queries**
   ```sql
   -- Identify slow queries
   SELECT 
       query,
       calls,
       total_time,
       mean_time,
       rows
   FROM pg_stat_statements
   ORDER BY total_time DESC
   LIMIT 20;
   
   -- Check index usage
   SELECT 
       relname as table_name,
       indexrelname as index_name,
       idx_scan as index_scans,
       idx_tup_read as tuples_read,
       idx_tup_fetch as tuples_fetched
   FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
   JOIN pg_statio_user_indexes USING (indexrelid)
   ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
   ```

2. **Regular Maintenance Tasks**
   ```sql
   -- Analyze tables to update statistics
   ANALYZE;
   
   -- Reclaim space and update statistics
   VACUUM FULL ANALYZE;
   
   -- Reindex to improve index performance
   REINDEX DATABASE healthcare_db;
   ```

## Scaling Strategy

### Vertical Scaling

1. **Resource Optimization**
   - Configure PostgreSQL memory parameters based on server capacity
   - Adjust work_mem, shared_buffers, and effective_cache_size
   - Optimize checkpoint settings to reduce I/O spikes

### Horizontal Scaling

1. **Read Replicas**
   - Direct read-heavy queries to replicas
   - Use application-level routing based on query type
   - Consider using PostgreSQL logical replication for selective data distribution

2. **Sharding Strategy (for future growth)**
   - Shard by facility or geographic region
   - Implement a routing layer to direct queries to appropriate shards
   - Consider using Citus or similar PostgreSQL extension for distributed tables
